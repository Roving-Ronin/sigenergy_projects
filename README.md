# Sigenergy Projects for Home Assistant

Welcome to the **sigenergy_projects** repo! This is my home for all things Sigenergy + Home Assistant. Here you'll find cards, templates, and a healthy dose of creative workarounds—because sometimes the best solutions are the ones you hack together at 2 AM.

## What’s Inside?

- **Custom Cards:** Visualize your Sigenergy data like a pro.
- **Templates:** Automate all the things (or at least the Sigenergy bits).
- **Workarounds:** Because not everything works out-of-the-box (yet).

## Who’s This For?

Anyone looking to supercharge their Home Assistant setup with Sigenergy integrations, or just someone who enjoys a good workaround.

## How to Use

1. Browse the folders for cards, templates, or hacks you need.
2. Copy, tweak, and enjoy.
3. Got improvements? PRs welcome!

## Why Sigenergy?

Because your smart home deserves a smarter energy system—and because Home Assistant users never settle for default.
