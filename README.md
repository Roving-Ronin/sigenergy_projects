# Sigenergy Projects for Home Assistant

Welcome to the **sigenergy_projects** repo! This is my home for all things Sigenergy + Home Assistant. Here you'll find cards, templates, and a healthy dose of creative workarounds—because sometimes the best solutions are the ones you hack together at 2 AM.

## What’s Inside?

- **Custom Cards:** Visualize your Sigenergy data like a pro.
- **Templates:** Automate all the things (or at least the Sigenergy bits).
- **Workarounds:** Because not everything works out-of-the-box (yet).

## Who’s This For?

Anyone looking to supercharge their Home Assistant setup with Sigenergy integrations, or just someone who enjoys a good workaround.

## How to Use
First and foremost this makes use of the amazing local modbus Sigenergy integration by Andrei Ignat: https://github.com/TypQxQ/Sigenergy-Local-Modbus/tree/main
I would recommend that you just go for it and do the full install with control not just monitoring as it opens up a lot more entities.

1. Ensure that you have file editor installed so you can upload the images. I have uploaded a few but the ultimate source for the images is: https://github.com/vdvmichel/sigen-app-images
2. In File Editor navigate to www and then create a new folder called "Sigenergy".
3. Go into the new folder and upload the images you want to use.
4. Browse the folders for cards, templates, or hacks you need.
5. Copy, tweak, and enjoy.
6. Got improvements? PRs welcome!
7. Double check the names of your entities and edit as required.

## Why Sigenergy?

Because your smart home deserves a smarter energy system—and because Home Assistant users never settle for default.
